.TH get_vaddr_for_device 3 "get virtual address for board by name"

.SH NAME
\f4get_vaddr_for_device\f1 - get virtual address for board by name

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\f4void *get_vaddr_for_device(char *\f2conf_file, \f4char *\f2board_spec\f4)\f1
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f4get_vaddr_for_device()\f1 routine returns a virtual address for a VME board specified with \f2board_spec\f1.  The
\f2board_spec\f1 is of the format: "\f2device_name[\f1repeater_num\f2][\f1board_num\f2]\f1".  For example, the third v450
board (starting from 0), in chassis/repeater/controller number 0 would be expressed as: "\f2v450[\f10\f2][\f12\f2]\f1".

This routine is used in conjuction with the \f4v120_config\f1 utility.  This utility reads a V120/VME configuration, configures
user specified A16/A24/A32 address spaces, probes for VME devices listed, and writes this to an output configuration file.  This 
filename is specified as \f2conf_file\f1 in the call to this routine.  In the output \f2conf_file\f1, the V120 devices are
listed as online or offline, and for each address space, have a start and end mapping register specified.  The VME devices are
listed as online or offline, and identify which V120 repeater and address space they are mapped through. 

The device name is one of the Highland Technology device names listed in \f2vme_search_specs_stor.h\f1 (structure definition is
in \f2vme_search_specs_sdef.h\f1).  Note, this file could be expanded by the user to include other VME devices.

The call \f4get_vaddr_for_device(\f2"conf_file"\f4, \f2"v450"\f4,\f2 0\f4)\f1, will construct a "v450[0]" string to lookup in \f4conf_file\f1, and then get the associated "v120[0]" device and A16 address space, and use the starting A16 page of \f2260\f1 and ending page of \f2261\f1 to map to that address space, and return a virtual address to the base address of the VME board.
